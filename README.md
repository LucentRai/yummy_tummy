<h3>Yummy Tummy<br/></h3>
<i>A digital interface to enrich our communitites.</i><br/><hr>

Yummy Tummy serves three categories of individuals in a locality whose help for each contributes to cashflow within the community while contributing to sustainable communities, and good health and well being. </br>

1.<b> Home-Chef </b>
  Our webapp provides platform for homechef to add their dishes and schedule it to sell in their choice of date and time.
  Moreover they dictate the price for each dish they prepare and wish to sell.
 
2.<b> Students/Workers </b>
  Focused to the busy people in their everyday struggle of life, our platform ensures they get fed healthy food (i.e. the food cooked in home for a family)
  They can choose the dish prepared by chef in their locality and place an order for food.
  
 3.<b> Young Hustlers/Students </b>
   For those who are young with lots of time and energy, our webapp provides them opportunity to make some money for their service of delivering food from    the chef in their locality to the consumers who placed an order in their own locality.

<h4>Our Main Idea</h4>

We are contributing for the sustainable community by creating a justified and valid cashflow within the community. 
The homechef (housewife/husband) who cooks for the family can cook for extra one or two people without much expense while maintaining the same quality for the consumer as for the family. 
Similarly, the one who is busy or unable to cooks doesn't have to rely on fast food and expensive expenditure in restaurants. Instead they can place an order for the house-cooked healthy and homely food.
As for the young studetns and hustlers who are interested in earning money, investing and saving, they have the perfect opportunity to raise money with their work of delivery/serving.

This moves the money from a working person to rightfully earned young students and contributes to woman being independent through a step in financial independence.
We hope for this to contribute as:
<ul><li>Good health & well being</li>
  <li>Sustainable cities & Communitites</li>
  <li>Gender Equality</li>
  <li>Quality Education</li></ul>
