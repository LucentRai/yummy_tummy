Yummy Tummy serves three categories of individuals in a locality whose help for each contributes to cashflow within the community while contributing to sustainable communities, and good health and well being. </br>

1.<b> Home-Chef </b>
  Our webapp provides platform for homechef to add their dishes and schedule it to sell in their choice of date and time.
  Moreover they dictate the price for each dish they prepare and wish to sell.
 
2.<b> Students/Workers </b>
  Focused to the busy people in their everyday struggle of life, our platform ensures they get fed healthy food (i.e. the food cooked in home for a family)
  They can choose the dish prepared by chef in their locality and place an order for food.
  
 3.<b> Young Hustlers/Students </b>
   For those who are young with lots of time and energy, our webapp provides them opportunity to make some money for their service of delivering food from    the chef in their locality to the consumers who placed an order in their own locality.
